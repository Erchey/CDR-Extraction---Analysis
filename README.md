# CDR-Extraction---Analysis
This project aims to develop a Call Detail Recording (CDR) management application using FastAPI. 
The primary focus is on managing CDRs and integrating contact information within a single database system.
The API will allow for efficient data extraction, processing, storage and retrieval of call records from a telecom equipment (PABX), along with maintaining a database of contact information.
